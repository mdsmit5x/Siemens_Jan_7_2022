**PURPOSE:** 

Upload code answers for this data engineering interviews.

*INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THIS REPO:** 

Clone this repo & upload your answers to Questions 1-3 in any 3rd party code repository like Github, Bitbubucket, or Gitlab. When you answered the questions in your repo, please send us a link to the repo for us to review.

You can develop your code in your language of choice, though most of the data team uses Python.


## Question 1 (code required): 
You have two arrays of integers.
```
a = [47,24,95,184,13,3,12,18]
b = [83,9,32,29,52,90,108,14]
```

Provide 2 or 3 different ways to calculate the pair of values (one value in each array) with the smallest non-negative difference.

Return the elements in the array and the smallest non-negative difference.

For example, the answer with array `a` & `b` above is `b = 14` and `a = 13` because their difference is `14-13 = 1`, which is the smallest non-negative difference.

We are not looking for the most optimal code, but a variety of methods you could use calculate the smallest different and why you would select one method over another.

## Question 2 (code required):
Create 2 lists of random integers between 1 and 1,000,000. Each list should be 5,000 integers long. 

Apply the multiple methods you derived in Question 1 with the 2 new arrays of integers you calculate in this question. 

Which algorithm performed best? Which algorithm performed worst? And why? What is the Big0 notation for each of your methods?


## Question 3 (no code required. We're only looking for a written response):
Conceptually, what are the different tools such as code libraries or infrastructure that could help you 
find the smallest non-negative difference between 1 million lists that are 5,000 integers long?
